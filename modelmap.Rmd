# Introduction

The Oak Ridges Moraine Groundwater Program (ORMGP) has been supporting partner agencies with their modelling studies for many years. Because of the large number of models that have been developed with the ORMGP area, many models exist, from 

# Model Mapping Tool

The ORMGP website can display the model boundaries for all documented modelling studies in the ORM area. To support partner agencies, website users now have the ability to select a municipal or watershed boundary and see all models that are affiliated with that boundary.

Areas where the interpolated water table surface is above ground, might reflect conditions where groundwater is actively discharging into river valley systems. An accompanying map named Potential Discharge Areas (PDAs; Figure 2) is created to identify those areas where the initially interpolated water table surface (prior to constraining the surface to ground elevation minus 0.5 m) was above ground. These areas might reflect important groundwater dependent habitat areas where cold groundwater discharges to the stream network. For instance, a review of cold-water fisheries mapping suggests a coincidence of observed cold water streams and the mapped PDAs.

# Level 1 (WT1) 
### Level 0 Plus Added Corrections

Closer examination of the WT0 suggested that there might be ways that the map could be improved using expert knowledge and additional data sources. With the corrections incorporated, the map is named Water Table Level 1 (WT1). Corrections made to WT0 include:


### Incorporation of Streams

Given the interconnectedness of the groundwater and surface water systems across the ORMGP area, as evidenced by the prevalence of perennial streams, it is postulated that, as groundwater discharges to streams, the streams reflect the elevation of the water table. By distributing “stream nodes” at an approximate 500 m spacing along mapped watercourses, elevations are collected as surrogate water table points allowing for the interpolated water table to be constrained in river valleys.
